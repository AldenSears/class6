# EBIO338/358: Analysis and Visualization of Biological Data
# Class 6: Data Exploration Practice

# Load data on the tropical forest national parks home to the mammals and bird populations from class
# The file is PlosBiology_TableS1_Class.csv. Name the data sites.


# Examine the first 5 lines and the structure of the data

# Summarize the number of years the sites have been studied

# Make a pie chart showing the number of years the sites have been studied and orient it so that the greatest number is on the left

# Summarize the number of species at the sites

# Create a frequency table of the number of sites in each region; each country


# What is the mean number of species per region rounded to the nearest whole number?

# Create a barplot showing variation in the number of species per region

# Add x and y axis labels and fill the black columns with pink hatching that descends from left to right

# Create a contingency table of the landscape types per region

# Create a boxplot of protected area size in hectares (PA_AREA) by region with nice axes labels
# Make the y-axis labels horizontal and ensure they are fully visible in the plot
# Make the width of the boxes proportional to the observations

# Create a boxplot of protected area size in hectares (PA_AREA) by landscape type with nice axes labels. Use notches and orient it horizontally
